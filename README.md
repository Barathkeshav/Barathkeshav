## Hi there, I'm Barath Keshav

Welcome to my github, I am a grad student persuing data analytics engineering with a passion for turning data into actionable insights. I'm skilled in programming languages like Python, C++, and MySQL, and have hands-on experience with data analysis, computer vision, and deep learning through academic projects which you can check out in my repository. Currently in my learning journey, i've been learning about data warehousing and different libraries in python for analysis and visualisation of data. 

I've always been a bit of a Curious Goerge in things that intrest me, trying to find out new information and knowledge. I am excited to see where this journey takes me.
